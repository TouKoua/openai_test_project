# openai_test_project

Project made for testing flutter/dart with Open AI. The goal was simply to use try integrating Open AI with Flutter and generating some simple images.

## Getting Started

First thing you need to do is create an Open AI account. If you already have one, you may skip this step.
Follow the link here to sign in or create a new account: https://openai.com/

## API Key
After creating an account, you will need to go to the cloud platform and generate a new API Key to use. Head over to the cloud platform site and hover the left side and click on the API Keys tab. From there you can create and name your new API Key.

## Environment File
Create a file in the lib folder called .env
This is where we will place the API key. Add the following line to the file and replace the text with the API key you have.
API_KEY = "Your API Key Here"


## That's It!
From here you should be all setup to run the application and create simple images using Dall-E and Open AI.
